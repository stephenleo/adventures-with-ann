    "# Approximate Nearest Neighbors on Elastic Search with Docker\n",

    "Scaling ANNs to the Hundred Millions\n",

    "\n",
    "Docker containers are crucial for Data Science at Scale [Link](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/09/03/what-is-mlops/). That's very well the case for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANNs) on \"big\" data too!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Everything must run in a container\n",
    "\n",
    "Speed and Accuracy (or Recall) are the top two considerations while choosing a Nearest Neighbors or Similarity Search algorithm. In my previous post, [KNN is Dead](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/knn-k-nearest-neighbors-is-dead-fc16507eb3e), I have proven the tremendous (>300X) speed advantage ANNs have over KNN at comparable accuracy. I've also discussed how you can choose the fastest, most accurate ANN algorithm on your own dataset [Link](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/how-to-choose-the-best-nearest-neighbors-algorithm-8d75d42b16ab). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, sometimes, in addition to speed and accuracy, you also need the ability to scale to large data volumes. The ease of distributing the data across multiple machines is a third consideration in these cases. Let's solve all these three considerations concurrently with the fantastic OpenDistro for Elastic Search [Link](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/) in this post.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Elastic Search (ES)?\n",
    "ES might be a foreign concept to many Data Scientists reading this post, so let me introduce why it is important beyond its typical usage by your IT team.\n",
    "\n",
    "ES is a search engine database that famously powers search capabilities across the massive volume of Wikipedia [Link](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/elasticsearch/). It allows for full-text search [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-text_search) similar to Apache Solr for those from the Hadoop world. ES's distributed nature means it can be scaled to handle huge data volumes by adding more servers/nodes similar to Hadoop. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the three reasons why Data Scientists would be interested in Elastic Seach.\n",
    "1. ***Scalable ANN***: OpenDistro ES distribution has implemented the HNSW ANN algorithm as a plugin [Link](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/features/knn.html). ES's distributed nature enables it to scale this high-speed, high-accuracy HNSW ANN search to many millions of records.\n",
    "2. ***Support***: Most modern IT and Infrastructure teams are already familiar with (and heavily using) ES. As a Data Scientist, you probably want the IT Infra team to set up and maintain the server hardware, so using a technology that they are already familiar with increases your chance of securing their support. This support can literally make or break the productionizing of your Data Science project, so don't underestimate it! \n",
    "3. ***Simpler Stack***: ES can be used as a database to store additional fields, which can then be queried together with the nearest neighbors. For example, if you search for nearest neighbors using product name embeddings, you can also get the product price, category, date added, etc. As long as you stored it in ES, you can retrieve it during the ANN search. This simplifies your application stack because you can get all the information you need from one place instead of querying the nearest neighbors from one location and then hitting another database to get the other fields for all these neighbors."
